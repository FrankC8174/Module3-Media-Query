# Module3-Media-Query
In this assignment we had to demonstrate our knowledge of media queries, and ways to apply the rule. 
Media queries are ways that allow you to adapt your designs to different screen sizes using css.
In this code we started off with 2 columns with or first break point at 500px, at which point we move from two columns to three columns with the increase in screen size. 
our next break point is 800px, at which time our columns increase by one to four, to accomodate the larger screeen size.
